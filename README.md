# Predicting-the-severity-of-UK-road-accidents

Emergency services in the UK (non-commercial entities) are looking into developing a
system to provide a more effective response in case of road accidents. They want to know if
it would be possible to predict the severity of an accident using some variables that can
potentially be gathered on the place of the accident. They provide you with a dataset of all
the accidents that occurred in 2019 in the UK which contain their variable of interest.
They want you to use machine learning techniques to predict the accident severity in details
(that is, whether an accident is “fatal”, “serious” or “slight” – 3 classes in total), from all the
other features in the dataset. For the avoidance of doubt, the information about accident
severity is contained in the column titled “accident_severity”.
They want to compare traditional machine learning algorithms with neural networks to see if
the latter offer significantly higher performance.
